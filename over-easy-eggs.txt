Ingredients:
 - eggs
 - butter (I pull off olive oil for this, but butter is better)
 - pepper
 - salt

Directions:
1. Heat butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it's hot and foamy.

2. Break eggs and gently slide into pan, one at a time. Reduce heat to low immediately. Season with pepper and salt as desired.

3. Cook slowly until whites are completely firm and yolks begin to thicken but are not hard.

4. Carefully slide a spatula under each egg and flip. Season with pepper and salt as desired. Cook until desired doneness.

5. Gentle heat ensures even cooking and prevents eggs from becoming tough and rubbery.
